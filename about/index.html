  <p>Hey, my name is Sander Harrewijnen. I&rsquo;m a full-time software developer interested in a wide variety of technological topics with a special place for better software practices. I work at ITQ and my role can best be described as Developer Advocate towards developer communities at our customers.</p>

<p>My own employer organized this pretty amazing event aimed at internal knowledge sharing and I took the opportunity to talk about the softer side of software development and what teams can do to ensure they are building the right thing, the right way, for the right people.
Enterprise DevOps TechCon 2023</p>
<p>This was the first edition of the Enterprise DevOps TechCon and I gave a talk about improving how software is made. It involved things like balanced team approach and variouspractices that sit around software development and can boost its impact.</p>

<p>Chistiaan Roeleveld and me did a talk about how an organization can succeed with better development and platform practices at the Dutch VMWare User Group event. Christiaan shared his experience with platform engineering and I took a software development angle. Sadly there&rsquo;s no recording of it.</p>
<h2 id="capicast">CapiCast</h2>
<p>I was invited to take part in a podcast (in Dutch) about developer experience. Listen to it here.</p>
