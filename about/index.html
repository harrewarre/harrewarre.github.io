<h1>Appearances and other stuff</h1>
<h2>ITQon 2024</h2>
<p>My own employer organized this pretty amazing event aimed at internal knowledge sharing and I took the opportunity to talk about the softer side of software development and what teams can do to ensure they are building the right thing, the right way, for the right people.</p>
<h2>Enterprise DevOps TechCon 2023</h2>
<p>This was the first edition of the Enterprise DevOps TechCon and I gave a talk about improving how software is made. It involved things like balanced team approach and variouspractices that sit around software development and can boost its impact.</p>
<h2>VMUGNL 2023</h2>
<p>Chistiaan Roeleveld and me did a talk about how an organization can succeed with better development and platform practices at the Dutch VMWare User Group event. Christiaan shared his experience with platform engineering and I took a software development angle. Sadly there's no recording of it.</p>
