      <description>With all the knowledge built up for my CFCD exam I did earlier I took another Cloud Foundry exam. The Pivotal flavor this time.
Not as involved as the other Cloud Foundry exam I did but still a wide variety of questions. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I screwed up all the Metrics questions, or that there was only 1 that I got incorrect.
Still really happy with the result.</description>

      <description>Hey look, I got certified in something :-)
After a good few nights of self-paced training and practice over at Pivotal I felt confident enough and took the CFCD exam. As you can see above, I passed!</description>
