<h2><a href="/blog/cloud-native-chronicles-balanced-teams/">Cloud Native Chronicles - Balanced teams</a></h2>
<p>The first episode is out! Johan and I talk about balanced teams.</p>
<p>In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander discuss the concept of balanced teams in cloud-native development.
They explore the essential roles needed for effective product development, the risks associated with not validating products, and the challenges posed by siloed organizations.</p>
<p>The conversation emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines and the need for leadership to drive cultural change within organizations.
Key takeaways include the necessity of diverse skill sets in teams and the dangers of building products without user validation.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/capicast-podcast-devex/">My first podcast appearance</a></h2>
<p>On the 9th of August 2022 <a href="https://twitter.com/thefluffysysop">Robert Kloosterhuis</a> and myself recorded a podcast episode with the nice folks at <a href="https://codecapi.nl">CodeCapi</a>. They invited us over to talk about developer experience. A pretty broad topic and we covered a lot of stuff in the recording.</p>
<p>This was my first experience with recording something so I was a bit nervous but in the end it was a great experience and I&rsquo;m very happy with the episode that came from it.</p>
