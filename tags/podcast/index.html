<h2><a href="/blog/chronicles-product-mindset/">Cloud Native Chronicles - Product Mindset</a></h2>
A new episode launched on the Cloud Native Chronicles podcast and we&rsquo;re talking about Product Mindset. We&rsquo;re a bit all over the place with this one but I think the main message is clear: Think about what you want to build and for who.
In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander explore the concept of a product mindset in software development.
They discuss the differences between building software and creating a product, emphasizing the importance of understanding stakeholder needs and engaging with them throughout the development process.

<h2><a href="/blog/capicast-podcast-devex/">My first podcast appearance</a></h2>
On the 9th of August 2022 Robert Kloosterhuis and myself recorded a podcast episode with the nice folks at CodeCapi. They invited us over to talk about developer experience. A pretty broad topic and we covered a lot of stuff in the recording.
This was my first experience with recording something so I was a bit nervous but in the end it was a great experience and I&rsquo;m very happy with the episode that came from it.
