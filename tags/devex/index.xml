      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think most developers have experienced a taks sitting in progress for days or even weeks (or&amp;hellip; months!) on end. This long running work eventually gets merged and released but it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong thing and a large part needs rework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution to this struggle is two-fold. The first half is getting invested in your customers. Talk to them, establish a good relation with the people that actually use the product you are building. Find out what they really need. This practice is known as User Centered Design and while I find it very interesting, it&amp;rsquo;s not the topic of this post. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at the other half, breaking down work into smaller pieces and the result of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
