<h2><a href="/blog/fairphone-5-app-switcher-fix/">Fairphone 5 app switcher fix</a></h2>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Turn of Desktop mode in Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Desktop mode</p>
<p>Putting this here in case the forum gets cleaned or closes or who knows what.
Quick one here for you Fairphone 5 users.</p>
<p>A while ago I wrote about my experience with the Fairphone 5 and that it was &ldquo;Meh&rdquo; at best due to some pretty annoying software issues.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/six-months-with-the-fairphone">Here is a link to that previous post.</a></p>
<p>Updates did not fix the issue since then, but an <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/latest-update-broke-multitasking-pane/105558/56">observant user on the Fairphone forum</a> noticed when his phone started acting up.
It has something to do with the &ldquo;Desktop mode&rdquo; that can be enabled via Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Desktop mode.</p>

<p>Somewhere in December of 2023 I got my Fairphone 5 delivered. I was using an iPhone 12 mini at the time that was suffering from a pretty degraded battery and was in need of something else. That iPhone was my first one and also my last, the lack of customization on iOS was also getting a bit of an annoyance so the choice for Android was not a difficult one.</p>

<h1 id="debloat-your-sony-smart-tv">Debloat your Sony smart TV</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little tweak for your Sony smart TV that runs Android.</p>
<p>The start screen for these TV&rsquo;s (at least mine did) has a section that shows you recommended apps. Having things recommended for me by some &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; has become
somewhat of an annoyance and the stuff it was showing me wasn&rsquo;t really helpful. Not terrible mind you, but I never clicked on a single one of them.</p>

<h4 id="update">Update</h4>
<p>After updating to a newer version, I couldn&rsquo;t get the below steps to work any more. Here is some extra stuff to get it to work again. It comes down to <code>build.prop</code> not accepting the changes you make because it&rsquo;s being loaded as read-only. Remounting the filesystem as read-write and then pushing the updated file will do the trick.</p>
<p>Run the following through ADB <strong>with root enabled</strong> (flash the SuperSU zip found on the lineage OS website and enable root in the developer settings).</p>
