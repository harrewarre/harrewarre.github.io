      <description>Time for something else for a change. Games! Summer vacation is here and you&amp;rsquo;re going to be away from your computer for a while. You still want to play some games, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to lug around your laptop.
Mobile phone gaming is kind of a trash fire with a few gems hidden here and there. To make your life a bit easier, here are my favorites to get you started.</description>

      <description>UPDATE
The testing appears to be done and is now part of the regular version of the game. This is still a handy guide for any future betas though.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a cool update for your Valheim linux server if you&amp;rsquo;re up from some beta testing.
The Valheim devs announced the Mistlands update and we can all get in on the action early through a beta branch on Steam (and GamePass). You can find out more about the update here and there&amp;rsquo;s a nice trailer here.</description>

      <title>Valheim server on Linux</title>

      <description>Here is a step-by-step guide for setting up a Valheim server on Linux. Having done it twice now I thought it would be a good idea to capture this somewhere so that next time I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look any of this up again.
The only assumptions being made here is that your server is running Ubuntu of some semi-recent version and a basic understanding of Linux.
SteamCMD The SteamCMD utility from Valve will help us install the gamefiles on the server.</description>

      <description>An underrated feature in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe I recently became the owner of a Nintendo Switch and with it, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Having played a bunch of Mario kart games in the past, I knew the basic mechanics of the game such as using the items you find and drifting through turns to gain boost. It was around the fourth or so race that my spidey-sense tingled enough for me to look into it.</description>

      <title>A game for programmers</title>

      <description>I play video games occasionally, and I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered a game (that was in my Steam library for quite some time already) that gives me the same sensation as when I&amp;rsquo;m programming.
The game I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is Factorio.
The goal of the game is simple, build a factory that produces all the required parts necessary to launch a rocket that carries a satellite into space. Building the factory is what made me fall in love with this game.</description>
