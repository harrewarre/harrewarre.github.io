<h2><a href="/blog/new-tech-2021/">It&#39;s new tech!</a></h2>
<p>I finally came up on the best excuse to upgrade my computer. My very generous employer, <a href="https://www.itq.eu">ITQ</a>, gave us the opportunity to upgrade our home office and that brought me the base for a new system.</p>
<p>The specs I finally settled on are built around PCI Gen 4 (future-proof a bit üòÄ) support which comes down to the following list of parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>
<li>Samsung 980 Pro 500GB</li>
<li>32GB G.Skill DDR4 3600MHz CL16 RAM</li>
<li>Corsair RM750x power supply</li>
</ul>
<p>To hold all the stuff I went with an NZXT H510 ATX case.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/going-4k/">Going 4K with the Philips BDM4065UC</a></h2>
<p>Dual screen setups are great for work but you can&rsquo;t always have two of the same size/model side by side. In my previous setup I had my laptop display as the primary and a secondary smaller screen. This being sub-optimal I figured it might be a good time to ask for a new display at <a href="http://www.itq.nl">work</a>. New screens are nice, but what to ask for? Research time!</p>
<p>I looked at a bunch of 1440p displays but with 4k becoming a more viable solution I started researching really big screens. During my search I came across this <a href="http://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2015/Nov/23/Going-Big-40-Glorious-inches-of-4k-with-the-Philips-BDM4065UC">post</a> by Rick Strahl and his 4k Philips display. I had seen this display in my search and it certainly looked good on paper but having someone actually use it for development purposes gave me a really good insight. I was sold. 4K should be the way to go.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/the-new-rig/">The new rig</a></h2>
<p>After saving up money for a while I bought myself a new desktop PC. Its main purpose would be gaming and some development stuff but since gaming has a big influence on the parts, I rolled with that. Here is the part list I ended up ordering.</p>
<h2 id="specs">Specs!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-6600.</li>
<li>Asus H170 Pro Gaming.</li>
<li>256GB Samsung SM951.</li>
<li>2x 8GB Kingston Hyper-X 2133MHz DDR4</li>
<li>MSI R9 390 8GB.</li>
<li>Seasonic G-Series 650 Watt.</li>
</ul>
<p>I re-used my (very) old case, a Cooler Master Centurion to hold all my parts.</p>
