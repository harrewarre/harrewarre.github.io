      <description>I finally came up on the best excuse to upgrade my computer. My very generous employer, ITQ, gave us the opportunity to upgrade our home office and that brought me the base for a new system.
The specs I finally settled on are built around PCI Gen 4 (future-proof a bit ðŸ˜€) support which comes down to the following list of parts:
 Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus AMD Ryzen 7 5800X Samsung 980 Pro 500GB 32GB G.</description>

      <description>Dual screen setups are great for work but you can&amp;rsquo;t always have two of the same size/model side by side. In my previous setup I had my laptop display as the primary and a secondary smaller screen. This being sub-optimal I figured it might be a good time to ask for a new display at work. New screens are nice, but what to ask for? Research time!
I looked at a bunch of 1440p displays but with 4k becoming a more viable solution I started researching really big screens.</description>
