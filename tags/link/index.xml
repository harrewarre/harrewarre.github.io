      <title>Best Simple System Now by Dan North</title>

      <description>A long-form post about focussing on the simplest system you can get away with right now. I like the idea but I bet it takes quite some discipline to not accidentally over or under-do the thing you are looking to ship.
 &amp;ldquo;We can do this the quick way and pay later, or the thorough way and pay now.&amp;rdquo; This seems to be a fundamental dichotomy in software development, between ‘perfectionism’ and ‘pragmatism’, but I do not think it has to be a trade-off at all.</description>

      <title>Forest &amp; Desert by Beth Andres-Beck</title>

      <description>The article describes two distinct cultures that exist for software development. The forest and the desert.
 There is a path from the desert to the forest, a series of small, safe steps a community can take to terraform the landscape. No developer can do it alone, and no amount of technology will get us there, but it is possible.
