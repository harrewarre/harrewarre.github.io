      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dual screen setups are great for work but you can&amp;rsquo;t always have two of the same size/model side by side. In my previous setup I had my laptop display as the primary and a secondary smaller screen. This being sub-optimal I figured it might be a good time to ask for a new display at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.itq.nl&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;. New screens are nice, but what to ask for? Research time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked at a bunch of 1440p displays but with 4k becoming a more viable solution I started researching really big screens. During my search I came across this &lt;a href=&#34;http://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2015/Nov/23/Going-Big-40-Glorious-inches-of-4k-with-the-Philips-BDM4065UC&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Rick Strahl and his 4k Philips display. I had seen this display in my search and it certainly looked good on paper but having someone actually use it for development purposes gave me a really good insight. I was sold. 4K should be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
