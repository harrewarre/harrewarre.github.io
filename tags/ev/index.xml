      <description>Having done a long drive into France not that long ago using an EV (a 2020 Polestar 2), I encountered some stuff that I thought was worth writing down.
Charging Let&amp;rsquo;s get some of the obvious stuff out of the way first. Yes, doing long trips in an EV requires a little bit of upfront planning so you wont run out of spark along the way. EVs also don&amp;rsquo;t have the same range as a petrol or diesel car, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stop more often.</description>

      <title>Polestar 2 battery state API</title>

      <description>Update in 2024:
It appears that Polestar is working on a proper API and folks have been figuring out how to get to the data used by the mobile app. See here for an example of a custom Home Assistant integration that surfaces quite a bit more than just the state of charge. This code will still work even with the existence of a polestar API but be aware that an official API might at some point appear.</description>
