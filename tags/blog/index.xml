      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first episode is out! Johan and I talk about balanced teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander discuss the concept of balanced teams in cloud-native development.&#xA;They explore the essential roles needed for effective product development, the risks associated with not validating products, and the challenges posed by siloed organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conversation emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines and the need for leadership to drive cultural change within organizations.&#xA;Key takeaways include the necessity of diverse skill sets in teams and the dangers of building products without user validation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A fresh start</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are looking at the new and improved blogging experience I made for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My old blog was running on Ghost and was a bit fed up with keeping it all working and up to date so I exported the posts and images and start working on something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had only one objective. Make it as simple as possible to create new content while also be able to easily maintain the blog itself. After some deep thought I ended up at ASP.NET Razor Webpages, it&amp;rsquo;s like MVC but without the M and the C. The code is a renderer for MarkDown, nothing more, nothing less.&#xA;There is some additional layout and styling but the content is stored in files which are gathered in an index from which I generate the pages you see. The whole thing also runs locally with minimal setup so it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to fix things and add content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
