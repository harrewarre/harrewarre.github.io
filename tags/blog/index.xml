      <description>The first episode is out! Johan and I talk about balanced teams.
In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander discuss the concept of balanced teams in cloud-native development. They explore the essential roles needed for effective product development, the risks associated with not validating products, and the challenges posed by siloed organizations.
The conversation emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines and the need for leadership to drive cultural change within organizations.</description>

      <description>You are looking at the new and improved blogging experience I made for myself.
My old blog was running on Ghost and was a bit fed up with keeping it all working and up to date so I exported the posts and images and start working on something new.
I had only one objective. Make it as simple as possible to create new content while also be able to easily maintain the blog itself.</description>
