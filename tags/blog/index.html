<h1>Blog</h1>


<h2><a href="/blog/a-fresh-start/">A fresh start</a></h2>
<p>You are looking at the new and improved blogging experience I made for myself.</p>
<p>My old blog was running on Ghost and was a bit fed up with keeping it all working and up to date so I exported the posts and images and start working on something new.</p>
<p>I had only one objective. Make it as simple as possible to create new content while also be able to easily maintain the blog itself. After some deep thought I ended up at ASP.NET Razor Webpages, it&rsquo;s like MVC but without the M and the C. The code is a renderer for MarkDown, nothing more, nothing less.
There is some additional layout and styling but the content is stored in files which are gathered in an index from which I generate the pages you see. The whole thing also runs locally with minimal setup so it&rsquo;s really easy to fix things and add content.</p>
