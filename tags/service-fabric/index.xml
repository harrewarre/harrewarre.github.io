      <description>Service Fabric is a great piece of technology on the Azure platform and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it quite a lot in recent projects. It takes away a lot of the setup and orchestration when dealing with microservices.
There comes a point where services need to talk to each other and this is easily achieved using the Remoting bits you can get from NuGet. The general way of doing this is creating an Interfaces project next to the service that contains the service interface and classes used in transport.</description>

      <description>So this hackathon/training thing popped up on my twitter feed a week before it actually started.
It caught my attention because it mentioned Azure Service Fabric as one of the tech stacks (the other being Kubernetes) that would be the focus of the event. The event is Openhack that took place in Amsterdam from 9 to 11 october 2017.
So Azure Service Fabric caught my attention because it&amp;rsquo;s a big part of the job I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on.</description>
