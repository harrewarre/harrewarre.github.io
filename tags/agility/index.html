<h2><a href="/blog/are-you-failing-enough/">Are you failing enough?</a></h2>
<p>The process of creating software, compared to other manufacturing processes, is a little bit special. One unique property of a software product is that it can be changed easily and (relatively) cheaply.</p>
<p>Over in the physical world, changing a product is not so easy. Supply chains, inventory, machinery, whole factories, who knows what&rsquo;s involved that is either difficult to change quickly and/or prohibitively expensive to change.</p>
<p>So what about this failing more often? Well if you have the ability to quickly change your software product, you can also run A LOT of experiments!</p>

<h2><a href="/blog/start-with-small-stories/">It all starts with smaller stories</a></h2>
<p>I think most developers have experienced a taks sitting in progress for days or even weeks (or&hellip; months!) on end. This long running work eventually gets merged and released but it turns out it&rsquo;s the wrong thing and a large part needs rework.</p>
<p>The solution to this struggle is two-fold. The first half is getting invested in your customers. Talk to them, establish a good relation with the people that actually use the product you are building. Find out what they really need. This practice is known as User Centered Design and while I find it very interesting, it&rsquo;s not the topic of this post. We&rsquo;re looking at the other half, breaking down work into smaller pieces and the result of doing so.</p>
