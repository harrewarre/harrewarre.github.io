      <description>&lt;p&gt;The process of creating software, compared to other manufacturing processes, is a little bit special. One unique property of a software product is that it can be changed easily and (relatively) cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over in the physical world, changing a product is not so easy. Supply chains, inventory, machinery, whole factories, who knows what&amp;rsquo;s involved that is either difficult to change quickly and/or prohibitively expensive to change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what about this failing more often? Well if you have the ability to quickly change your software product, you can also run A LOT of experiments!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think most developers have experienced a taks sitting in progress for days or even weeks (or&amp;hellip; months!) on end. This long running work eventually gets merged and released but it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong thing and a large part needs rework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution to this struggle is two-fold. The first half is getting invested in your customers. Talk to them, establish a good relation with the people that actually use the product you are building. Find out what they really need. This practice is known as User Centered Design and while I find it very interesting, it&amp;rsquo;s not the topic of this post. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at the other half, breaking down work into smaller pieces and the result of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
