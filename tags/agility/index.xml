      <description>The process of creating software, compared to other manufacturing processes, is a little bit special. One unique property of a software product is that it can be changed easily and (relatively) cheaply.
Over in the physical world, changing a product is not so easy. Supply chains, inventory, machinery, whole factories, who knows what&amp;rsquo;s involved that is either difficult to change quickly and/or prohibitively expensive to change.
So what about this failing more often?</description>

      <description>I think most developers have experienced a taks sitting in progress for days or even weeks (or&amp;hellip; months!) on end. This long running work eventually gets merged and released but it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong thing and a large part needs rework.
The solution to this struggle is two-fold. The first half is getting invested in your customers. Talk to them, establish a good relation with the people that actually use the product you are building.</description>
