    <h1>Gaming on your phone</h1>
<p>Time for something else for a change. Games! Summer vacation is here and you're going to be away from your computer for a while. You still want to play some games, but you don't want to lug around your laptop.</p>
<p>Mobile phone gaming is kind of a trash fire with a few gems hidden here and there. To make your life a bit easier, here are my favorites to get you started.</p>
<p>Not all free, but definitely worth the price if you want to play some games on your phone that aren't ad infested garbage.</p>
<h3>Vampire Survivors</h3>
<p>Simple mechanics with an absurd amount of replay-ability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mow down thousands of night creatures and survive until dawn! Vampire Survivors is a gothic horror casual game with rogue-lite elements, where your choices can allow you to quickly snowball against the hundreds of monsters that get thrown at you.</p>

<h3>Luck be a Landlord</h3>
<p>A roguelike slotmachine where you get to pick the symbols on the machine. Endless fun and a great way to kill some time.</p>
<blockquote>
