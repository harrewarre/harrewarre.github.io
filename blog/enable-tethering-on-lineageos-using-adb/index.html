<h4>Update</h4>
<p>After updating to a newer version, I couldn't get the below steps to work any more. Here is some extra stuff to get it to work again. It comes down to <code>build.prop</code> not accepting the changes you make because it's being loaded as read-only. Remounting the filesystem as read-write and then pushing the updated file will do the trick.</p>
<p>Run the following through ADB <strong>with root enabled</strong> (flash the SuperSU zip found on the lineage OS website and enable root in the developer settings).</p>
<p>// Get the required root access.
adb root;
// Mount the filesystem as read-write.
adb shell mount -o rw,remount /;
// Now you can push in the updated build.prop file.</p>

<p>A while back I tried the successor to Cyanomod, LineageOS on my OnePlus2 to see if was any good. I really liked it but there were some things that didn't work and it wasn't very stable yet either so I went back to the stock OxygenOS ROM. This weekend, the itch came back and I gave it another go. I was very happy to see that LineageOS works very well now (the only missing thing is Bluetooth audio track info).</p>
<p>My long commute on Mondays by train lets me get some work done but to be able to access everything I need to be online. Mobile hotspot solves this problem easily and it's what I use when on the train. When I got on the train this morning I found that tethering wasn't available on the ROM I was using!</p>

<p>This was no good if I were to get anything done.</p>
<p>A quick search on my phone led me to a helpful post about editing the <code>build.prop</code> file. This file controls all sorts of things on your phone including the availability of tethering. First thing I needed was the value I had to add to the prop file to get tethering enabled. Turns out the name and value for that are <code>net.tethering.noprovisioning=true</code>.
Easy enough, but now to get that into the <code>build.prop</code> file without rooting (I have no need for root, so why bother).</p>
<p>The Android Debug Bridge (adb) is what you can use to pull and push files from and to the phone so that's the direction I took. After hooking up the phone and enabling USB debugging I took the following steps to update my <code>build.prop</code> file:</p>
<p>adb reboot recovery</p>
<p>This loads the phone into recovery mode (I'm using TWRP).</p>
<p>adb pull /system/build.prop</p>
<p>Downloads the file to my laptop so I can edit it. This is where you add <code>net.tethering.noprovisioning=true</code> to the file.</p>
<p>adb push build.prop /system/build.prop</p>
<p>Upload the file back to the phone.</p>
<p>adb reboot</p>
<p>Reboot back to the main operating system.</p>
<p>Lo and behold! It works again :-)</p>

<p>Just a few easy steps and we are back online.</p>
