<h1>Fairphone 5 app switcher fix</h1>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Turn of Desktop mode in Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Desktop mode</p>
<p>Putting this here in case the forum gets cleaned or closes or who knows what.
Quick one here for you Fairphone 5 users.</p>
<p>A while ago I wrote about my experience with the Fairphone 5 and that it was &quot;Meh&quot; at best due to some pretty annoying software issues.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/six-months-with-the-fairphone">Here is a link to that previous post.</a></p>
<p>Updates did not fix the issue since then, but an <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/latest-update-broke-multitasking-pane/105558/56">observant user on the Fairphone forum</a> noticed when his phone started acting up.
It has something to do with the &quot;Desktop mode&quot; that can be enabled via Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Desktop mode.</p>
<p>I had played around with the desktop mode a bit when I got my phone, but it isn't all that great and kinda buggy (this setting is not hidden behind the Developer Options!).
Of course I didn't turn it back off after deciding that the desktop was not in a usable state and so my problems persisted.</p>
<p>Leaving that setting enabled appears to mess up things in the not-Desktop-mode!</p>
<p>After turning it off all my app switcher issues with third-party launchers went away.
My only other gripe with the device also solved itself, I got rid of Google Pay after getting fed up with the flaky NFC behavior it shows on about half the payments I attempt.
Bonus: also great for privacy.</p>
<p>Official support was sadly completely useless throughout all of this. It always ended in &quot;Thank you for your feedback&quot; and that was it.</p>
<p>Well it appears my Android experience is saved and I hope they fix the desktop mode or just pull the feature all together because it's causing a pretty nasty problem for those enabling this setting.</p>
<p>For now it's all good though.</p>
