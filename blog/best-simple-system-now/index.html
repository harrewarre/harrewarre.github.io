<h1>Best Simple System Now by Dan North</h1>
<p>A long-form post about focussing on the simplest system you can get away with <strong>right now</strong>.
I like the idea but I bet it takes quite some discipline to not accidentally over or under-do the thing you are looking to ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We can do this the quick way and pay later, or the thorough way and pay now.&quot; This seems to be a fundamental dichotomy in software development, between ‘perfectionism’ and ‘pragmatism’, but I do not think it has to be a trade-off at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Best Simple System for Now is the simplest system that meets the needs of the product right now, written to an appropriate standard. It has no extraneous or over-engineered code, and any code it does have is exactly as robust and reliable as it needs to be, neither more nor less.</p>
