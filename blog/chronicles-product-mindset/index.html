        <p>A new episode launched on the Cloud Native Chronicles podcast and we're talking about Product Mindset.
We're a bit all over the place with this one but I think the main message is clear: Think about what you want to build and for who.</p>
<p>In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander explore the concept of a product mindset in software development.</p>
<p>They discuss the differences between building software and creating a product, emphasizing the importance of understanding stakeholder needs and engaging with them throughout the development process.</p>
<p>The conversation highlights the significance of early feedback, iterative planning, and team collaboration, using Tesla as a case study to illustrate successful product development strategies.</p>
<p>The episode concludes with key takeaways on starting small and fostering a cultural shift towards agile methodologies.</p>
