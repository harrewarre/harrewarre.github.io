<h1>Cloud Foundry buildpack environment variables</h1>
<p>I recently ran into a situation I hadn't dealt with before.</p>
<p>A Python app I was working on was loading modules from a location outside of Pythons known locations.
My first instinct was to update the <code>manifest.yml</code> <code>env</code> section with a <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable that would add this additional location to the Python path but that would not stick.
Using <code>cf set-env</code> to update the variable after the fact also did not work.</p>
<p>The environment variable was already set and consumed before we could apply our changes! The cause for this is the buildpack. The <code>python_buildpack</code> I was using was explicitly setting the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> and by the time we applied our changes it was already to late for our changes to take effect.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Cloud Foundry buildpacks have a solution for this.
You can add a <code>.profile</code> file to the root of your project (from where <code>cf push</code> runs) and use that to run scripts during the release stage of the buildpack.</p>
<p>The contents of the <code>.profile</code> ended up looking like this:</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">PYTHONPATH</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable">$PYTHONPATH</span><span class="token builtin class-name">:</span><span class="token environment constant">$HOME</span>/submodules/my-module</code></pre>
<p>When the app is now deployed the buildpack will ensure that the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is set correctly and the rest of the app can load the additional submodules.</p>
