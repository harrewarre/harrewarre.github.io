<h1>Environment variables in an Azure Web App for Containers</h1>
<p>Here's a little gotcha I ran into. A .net core app I wrote needs to run inside a container and the target was a Web App for Containers on the Azure platform. No big deal so far.</p>
<p>The app also needs a few settings for it to do its work. We provide these via environment variables for maximum flexibility. After setting up some CI/CD stuff and deploying the app it wouldn't start because it wasn't loading the settings.</p>
<p>But why?? The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#hierarchical-configuration-data">spec</a> is pretty clear on how to write the keys for the settings in such a way that .net understands them.</p>
<p><img src="settings.png" alt="Settings"></p>
<p>So the secret sauce to this problem is replacing <code>:</code> in the settings for your app with <code>__</code> (that's 2 underscores). I managed to get to this by messing around (there were some other settings with just 1 <code>_</code> as well ...) and I wasn't able to find an official source for this.</p>
<p>It probably has something to do with passing stuff on the command-line that launches the container and the arguments containing <code>:</code>-characters, I have no idea. Using <code>__</code> is what works right now 🙂</p>
