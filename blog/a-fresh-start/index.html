  <h1>A fresh start</h1>
  <p>You are looking at the new and improved blogging experience I made for myself.</p>
<p>My old blog was running on Ghost and was a bit fed up with keeping it all working and up to date so I exported the posts and images and start working on something new.</p>
<p>I had only one objective. Make it as simple as possible to create new content while also be able to easily maintain the blog itself. After some deep thought I ended up at ASP.NET Razor Webpages, it&rsquo;s like MVC but without the M and the C. The code is a renderer for MarkDown, nothing more, nothing less.
There is some additional layout and styling but the content is stored in files which are gathered in an index from which I generate the pages you see. The whole thing also runs locally with minimal setup so it&rsquo;s really easy to fix things and add content.</p>
<p>To find out how the whole thing works, check out the code yourself on Github in <a href="https://github.com/harrewarre/blog">this</a> repo.</p>
<p>The last part is being more disciplined when it comes to writing new content. I feel like I should write more often, so who knows, if the subjects are there, I might actually do it :-)</p>
<p>There was something going on with the DNS records so if you don&rsquo;t see this or get a nasty 404 from Microsoft Azure&hellip; that&rsquo;s on me&hellip;</p>
