      <description>But lets clamp that down right away, this is more about LLMs, and even more specificically, code generation using LLMs.
GitHub CoPilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, you name it, it&amp;rsquo;s everywhere in developer land. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github CoPilot (in the browser for now) to have it do some work for a while now and it&amp;rsquo;s been hit-and-miss. It&amp;rsquo;ll do the boilerplate stuff well enough but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s very easy get served something that makes no sense.</description>

      <description>In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and I discuss the concept of the 10-minute build, emphasizing its importance in maintaining developer focus and efficiency.
We explore the technical and cultural aspects of build processes, the significance of team dynamics, and the necessity of standardizing builds across different teams. The conversation also touches on the balance between speed and reliability in software deployment, advocating for a culture of confidence in shipping software quickly while minimizing risks.</description>

      <description>Pivotal Tracker is an application designed to help teams manage their projects using agile methodologies. It allows users to create and prioritize stories, tasks, and epics, and collaborate in real-time with other developers.
Sadly, Pivotal Tracker is being shut down.
The linked site shows teams that are working hard to build the next iteration of this tool to allow teams to collaborate around a shared backlog of stories in real time.</description>

      <description>A new episode launched on the Cloud Native Chronicles podcast and we&amp;rsquo;re talking about Product Mindset. We&amp;rsquo;re a bit all over the place with this one but I think the main message is clear: Think about what you want to build and for who.
In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander explore the concept of a product mindset in software development.
They discuss the differences between building software and creating a product, emphasizing the importance of understanding stakeholder needs and engaging with them throughout the development process.</description>

In this episode of Cloud Native Chronicles, hosts Johan and Sander discuss the concept of balanced teams in cloud-native development. They explore the essential roles needed for effective product development, the risks associated with not validating products, and the challenges posed by siloed organizations.
The conversation emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines and the need for leadership to drive cultural change within organizations.</description>

      <title>Best Simple System Now by Dan North</title>
      <link>https://harre.dev/blog/best-simple-system-now/</link>

      <description>A long-form post about focussing on the simplest system you can get away with right now. I like the idea but I bet it takes quite some discipline to not accidentally over or under-do the thing you are looking to ship.
 &amp;ldquo;We can do this the quick way and pay later, or the thorough way and pay now.&amp;rdquo; This seems to be a fundamental dichotomy in software development, between ‘perfectionism’ and ‘pragmatism’, but I do not think it has to be a trade-off at all.</description>

      <title>Forest &amp; Desert by Beth Andres-Beck</title>
      <link>https://harre.dev/blog/forest-and-desert/</link>

      <description>The article describes two distinct cultures that exist for software development. The forest and the desert.
 There is a path from the desert to the forest, a series of small, safe steps a community can take to terraform the landscape. No developer can do it alone, and no amount of technology will get us there, but it is possible.

      <title>Team priorities</title>

      <description>Not all work is equally important in the stream of stuff that needs to get done when building and shipping software. So how do you make sense of what to work on?
If work items are prioritized outside your development team, you need to have a discussion about ownership. A team that does not have control over what to work on is not in a position of ownership and (assuming the team is working in good faith) cannot be held responsible for any misaligned outcomes.</description>
