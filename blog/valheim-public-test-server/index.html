<h1>Valheim public-test server</h1>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>The testing appears to be done and is now part of the regular version of the game. This is still a handy guide for any future betas though.</p>
<p>Here's a cool update for <a href="valheim-linux-server.md">your Valheim linux server</a> if you're up from some beta testing.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The Valheim devs announced the Mistlands update and we can all get in on the action early through a beta branch on Steam (and GamePass). You can find out more about the update <a href="https://valheim.com/news/mistlands-public-test/">here</a> and there's a nice trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/cZOuBjvETR8">here</a>.</p>
<p>To update your game to the <code>public-test</code> version you have to opt into the beta version by going to the game's properties in Steam, selecting Betas and then entering <code>yesimadebackups</code> to unlock the public-test version. Once you've unlocked it you can update to this beta version of the game.</p>
<p>As with any beta or public-test stuff, there's going to be bugs and you can lose your world and/or your character. The game also warns about this. With that out of the way, let's update the server.</p>
<p>Before doing anything, make sure you stop your game server.</p>
<p>sudo systemctl stop valheim</p>
<p>Once stopped we need to make a backup of the world, just in case anything goes bad. The world files are stored at <code>~/.config/unity3d/Irongate/Valheim/worlds_local/</code> so we just copy everything in there to a different folder.</p>
<p>cp ~/.config/unity3d/IronGate/Valheim/worlds_local/<em>.</em> ~/valheim-backup/</p>
<p>Next up, updating the game. Let's have a quick look at the command we used to installed the stable version before we do anything.</p>
<p>steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/harre/.steam/steamapps/common/valheim +app_update 896660 validate +exit</p>
<p>To get into the public-test version we need to specify which branch we want to download and also specify the beta password. Having a quick look in the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD">docs</a> and searching for the word <code>branch</code> gives us the things we need to supply to the <code>app_update</code> command.</p>
<p>-beta <branch name> -betapassword <password></p>
<p>Which for Valheim <code>public-test</code> becomes</p>
<p>-beta public-test -betapassword yesimadebackups</p>
<p>Then added to the existing command we already have:</p>
<p>steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir /home/harre/.steam/steamapps/common/valheim +app_update 896660 -beta public-test -betapassword yesimadebackups validate +exit</p>
<p>Run the command and wait for the game to download and install. Once completed you can start the server back up. Everthing we configured during the setup <a href="valheim-linux-server.md">in this post</a> should still work.</p>
<p>sudo systemctl start valheim</p>
<p>Now you're all set up to connect the game to your server and start exploring those Mistlands. Have fun out there!</p>
