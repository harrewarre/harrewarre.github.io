<p>Here's a little tweak for your Sony smart TV that runs Android.</p>
<p>The start screen for these TV's (at least mine did) has a section that shows you recommended apps. Having things recommended for me by some &quot;&quot;&quot;algorithm&quot;&quot;&quot; has become
somewhat of an annoyance and the stuff it was showing me wasn't really helpful. Not terrible mind you, but I never clicked on a single one of them.</p>

<p>It wasn't until I installed VLC to play some videos of a USB stick. Every time I wanted to start the app, it was all the way at the end of my 'recommended' apps.
Now this was a problem. Not only taking up space, but also getting in the way. That crap needed to go.</p>
<p>After digging through all the settings and options in the settings menu I wasn't able to find anything that referred to that section on the start screen
and the manual (yes, I opened, and read it! ... well skimmed it) did mention it, but only its existence on the screen, no options.</p>
<p>Turns out, there's a system app on the TV called <strong>SonyShelf</strong> that's in charge of that portion of the screen.</p>

Sorry about the Dutch text :-)<br />
Force close -> Gedwongen stoppen.<br />
Notifications -> Meldingen.

<ol>
<li>Open the settings menu.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Apps</strong> section and open it.</li>
<li>Scroll all the way down to where you see the SonyShelf app and select it.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Force close&quot; and disable notifications.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>A garbage free start screen showing a list of installed apps instead of a double row of crap.</p>

<p>It didn't come back after a reboot, I tried, and is also the reason the first image is a pic I found online because I couldn't get it back for a picture...
But I assume you might have to repeat this process at some point due to updates and whatnot. Enjoy!</p>
