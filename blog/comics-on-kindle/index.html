    <h1>Read comics on your Kindle e-reader</h1>
<p>Vacation is coming and I was looking at stuff to put on my Kindle e-reader. Found some books to read and then I came across comic books on Amazon. Nothing sparked my interest right away but it did remind me of some old comics I read a looooong time ago (of which I still have the actual paper versions!).</p>
<p>The specific comics are about Storm, a dude's adventure after falling into Jupiters great red spot and accidentally traveling through time in the process.</p>
<p>Sadly Amazon didn't give me anything but hardcovers but I managed to get my hands on some digital versions after some thorough google-fu.
Having the digital versions was just the first step, now I had to get them onto my kindle while also keeping it readable. Google to the rescue again.</p>
<p>The first tool you'll need for doing this is <a href="https://kcc.iosphe.re/">Kindle Comic Converter</a> (or KCC). This will turn your digital comics into something
an e-reader understands. Except for the Kindle mobi format, you'll need an additional tool (which KCC will tell you about when you select Kindle mobi output).
You can download <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211">KindleGen</a> from Amazon and need to place the <code>.exe</code> into the KCC directory for it to work. Nothing to complicated.</p>
<p>With all this setup out of the way, it's time to convert those archives into <code>.mobi</code> files.
This will take a little bit of time, depending on the size of the archives that are converted.</p>
<p>Once you have the Kindle prefered format, grab trusty old <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> and use it to send the e-books to your device!</p>

<p>It took a little bit of google-fu but the result is pretty good. The screen of the Kindle Paperwhite I have is a bit on the small side for what I'm trying to read,
but zooming and panning work very well.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that converting a full-color comic for an e-reader will obviously remove all the color but the results are good enough for what I want.</p>
