        <h1>SpringOne Platform 2019</h1>
<p>Pivotal organized another SpringOne conference this year, and the ITQ Cloud Native team hopped across the large pond into the Texes heat to attend.</p>

<h2>Spring for the .net dev</h2>
<p>While Spring is a Java thing, SteelToe is there for us .net folks. It's getting a big shot of TLC with a new website and new and improved docs!
Creating microservices using .net got a bit easier than it already was with some new stuff such as actuators and service connectors.
Go have a look at the <a href="https://www.steeltoe.io">SteelToe website</a> for all the ins and outs. (also, <a href="https://start.steeltoe.io">this</a> exists to quickly start a new service)</p>
<h2>Azure Spring Cloud</h2>
<p>A very nice surprise is the a fully managed Spring Cloud option over on Microsoft Azure. It's still very much a preview but you can already use it to host your Spring microservices.
It being a fully managed setup means that things like service discovery and configuration server and the cluster itself are all taken care of.</p>
<p><img src="azure-spring-cloud.png" alt="Austin capitol"></p>
<p>I requested access to the preview and was allowed in to play around a bit. My one wish currently is the ability to upload a .net core <code>.dll</code> in there instead of <code>.jar</code> files. There's no word out there but given the work being done on SteelToe, I don't see any reason why that feature should not exist.</p>
<p>More info on Azure Spring cloud can be found <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/spring-cloud/">here</a> (You can request preview access there as well).</p>
<h2>The <code>cf push</code> experience and kubernetes</h2>
<p>Given my experience with Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, it still saddens me you can't &quot;just push&quot; something onto k8s. That might be over soon though because with the rise of <a href="https://github.com/buildpack/pack">pack</a> and <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/blog/introducing-kpack-a-kubernetes-native-container-build-service">kpack</a> we might see something similar soon! (k)pack make use of <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">cloud native buildpacks</a> to create runnable images from source.</p>
<p>We got to see some pretty cool demos from both a dev and SRE perspective. It takes away all the dockerfile nonsense but also allows for managing the layers in the image.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p><img src="austin.png" alt="Austin capitol"></p>
<p>We had a bit of time off so we went on a tour the most Dutch way possible, on bicycles. Enjoyed the local food and beer. And a visit to Texas wouldn't be complete without a visit to the gun range.</p>
<p>Like my previous experiences in the US, the city is very nice mostly, but the social issues in the US clearly show when you walk/ride around town.</p>
<p>Hot, it was extremely hot. Maybe not crazy hot by Texan standards, but compared to our rainy little Netherlands, extremely hot ðŸ˜„.</p>
<p>Still not a fan of the long flights but all in all it was great.</p>
