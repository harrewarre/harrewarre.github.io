        <p>I've been working with a lot of forms lately and it required some kind of grid system to make it all lay out nicely. I've always been a bit hesitant to immediatly pull in another dependency and decided I was going to solve this one myself. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>By using the CSS flex layout, I ended up with just the right amount of flexibility and extensibility while keeping things very small code wise. Let's have a look!</p>
<p>Every line on the form is treated as a row in the grid, easy. These rows are divided up into columns, which can have variable widths and have to be elastic.</p>
<h2>Rows</h2>
<p>This element will contain our columns and is very straight forward.</p>
<p>.row {
display: flex;
}</p>
<p>That's all we need for rows.</p>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<p>These are a tiny bit more involved, but not much. Since the element that contains these uses <code>flex</code>, we can flex these elements as well!</p>
<p>.row .col {
flex: 1;
}</p>
<p>This requires a bit of explaining. The <code>1</code> in <code>flex: 1;</code> is called the flex factor. It tells the box model how much space an element will receive within its parent. Setting the flex factor on an element to <code>2</code> will cause that element to take twice as much space as an element that has a flex factor of <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>It's the same as setting <code>flex: 1 1 0;</code> which sets the grow and shrink factors to <code>1</code> and the basis to <code>0</code>. If you want to read more on what those values mean and do, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-common">here's the official spec</a>. It's quite expansive but also a bit beyond the scope of this post :-)</p>
<h2>The grid</h2>
<p>So at this point we have the most basic setup we can get, we can create rows and slice them up into evenly spaced columns.</p>
<p><img src="simple-columns.png" alt="Simple columns"></p>
<p>This gets us quite a long way already, but I also need columns that are constrained in some way. For this example, I'll add columns that always take 1/4th of the available space.</p>
<p>.row .col-1-4 {
flex: 1 1 25%;
max-width: 25%;
}</p>
<p>Time for a little bit of an explanation. Instead of just <code>flex: 1;</code> we are now setting all the flex properties in one go. We still allow growing and shrinking but we also define a basis (in this case 25%) from which the element will start resizing. To make sure the element never goes beyond the width we want it to be, we set a <code>max-width</code> to keep it from growing past a certain point (also 25% in the example).</p>
<p>With this column definition we can create columns that are still flexible but never grow beyond a certain size.</p>
<p><img src="fixed-width-columns.png" alt="Fixed width columns"></p>
<p>With this example in hand, we can now create all sorts of layouts any way we like.</p>
<p><img src="mixed-columns.png" alt="Mixing it up"></p>
<p>Creating new sizes is very easy, just add more rules for any size you want.</p>
<p>.row .col-1-2 {
flex: 1 1 50%;
max-width: 50%;
}</p>
<p>The CSS above will create a column that will take up half the space of a row. Any width, even fixed width is possible, just replace the percentage with a value in <code>px</code>.</p>
<p>The flex layout can help you build amazing things, even when it all seems so simple.</p>
