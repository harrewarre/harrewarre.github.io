  <h1>Creating release notes with Visual Studio and TFS</h1>
  <p>Here is a scenario for you. You&rsquo;ve been slaving away at the next big release of your product, fixing reported bugs, adding features and cleaning up code. Lot&rsquo;s of changes all over your code. Then comes that moment that you want to ship all that delicious code to your customers.</p>
<p>You prep a release build, zip it up and are pretty much done. Except for the release notes&hellip; What changed since the previous release?</p>
<p>Before you can start gathering your changes, I hope you tracked everything somewhere, preferably digitally and searchable. If not, then all you have is your check-ins, which is at least something. No check-in history either? Well then you are out of luck (and you need to upgrade your development process!)</p>
<p>So you did track every change properly? Good, lets get that list compiled (This example uses Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio 2013, but I assume other setups will have similar functionality). All you need is the date on which you released the previous version of your software.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it is the 21st of May, 2015. Lets say we released a month ago (30 days, to make this an easy example). Go to the Work Items section of the Team Explorer in Visual Studio and create a new query. In my example I query for Tasks, Bugs, and Features. To get only the items that we changed after the previous release, we set the Change Date to <strong>@Today - 30</strong>, this will give us all bugs, tasks, and features that were changed after we last released a new version our software.</p>

<p>You can of course create any query that matches your preference for this, but I found this way working very nicely. You can export the list to Excel and clean it up a bit before sticking it in a PDF and bundling it with your software.</p>
<p>Now that you have your release notes, hurry up and ship it! ;-)</p>
